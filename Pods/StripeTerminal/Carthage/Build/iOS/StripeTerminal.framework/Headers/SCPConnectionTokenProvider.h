/**
 Before integrating the SDK, you should create an endpoint on your backend
 server that creates a new connection token via the Stripe Terminal API. The
 connection token is used by the SDK to connect to a reader.

 An overview of the lifecycle of a connection token:
 - When Stripe Terminal is initialized, the SDK attempts to proactively request
 an connection token from your backend server.
 - The SDK uses the connection to connect to a reader.
 - Subsequent calls to connect require a new connection token. If you disconnect
 from a reader, and then call connect again, the SDK will need a new connection
 token from your backend server.

 We suggest making your application's API client conform to this protocol.

 @see https://stripe.com/docs/terminal/sdk/ios#connection-token

 On your backend server, use Stripe's `/v1/terminal/connection_tokens` endpoint to
 create a connection token, and return the `connection_token` string from the response
 to your app. In your app, call the completion block with the connection token,
 or an error if fetching the token failed.
